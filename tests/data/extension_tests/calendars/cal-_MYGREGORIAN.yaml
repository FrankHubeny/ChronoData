specification:

    The Gregorian calendar is the now-ubiquitous calendar introduced by Pope
    Gregory XIII in 1582 to correct the Julian calendar which was slowly drifting
    relative to the seasons.
    
    Permitted months are
    
    | `stdTag` | Name      |
    | :------- | :-------- |
    | `_MYJAN`    | My January   |
    | `_MYFEB`    | My February  |
    | `_MYMAR`    | My March     |
    | `_MYAPR`    | My April     |
    | `_MYMAY`    | My May       |
    | `_MYJUN`    | My June      |
    | `_MYJUL`    | My July      |
    | `_MYAUG`    | My August    |
    | `_MYSEP`    | My September |
    | `_MYOCT`    | My October   |
    | `_MYNOV`    | My November  |
    | `_MYDEC`    | My December  |
    
    The epoch marker `BC` is permitted in this calendar; year *y* BC indicates a
    year *y* years before year 1. Thus, there is no year 0; year 1 BCE was followed
    by year 1.
