'''This module of classes was generated by methods in the `Construct` class
of the `util` module from GEDCOM yaml specification files.  

They should not be manually altered, but the `Construct` class should be changed
if needed and the classes modules from each GEDCOM version regenerated.

The specifications for this module are from the 
[GEDCOM files](https://github.com/FamilySearch/GEDCOM-registries) for version 7.0.

    > Map
    > A representative point for a location, as defined by `LATI` and `LONG`
    > substructures.
    > 
    > Note that `MAP` provides neither a notion of accuracy (for example, the `MAP`
    > for a birth event may be some distance from the point where the birth occurred)
    > nor a notion of region size (for example, the `MAP` for a place "Belarus" may
    > be anywhere within that nation's 200,000 square kilometer area).
    > 

    Examples:
        The following example illustrates how to enter latitude (Lati) and longitude (Long)
        coordinates into a map structure to produce the GEDCOM output.
        >>> from genedata.util import Input

    Examples:
        These are the steps to build the example in the specification.
        First import the classes and build a multimedia cross reference identifier.
        >>> from genedata.build import Genealogy
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import File, Form, Medi, RecordObje
        >>> g = Genealogy('example')
        >>> obje_xref = g.multimedia_xref('M1')

        Next construct the ged lines.  Let `photo.jpg` be the file name of the photo.
        >>> m = RecordObje(obje_xref, File('photo.jpg', Form('image/jpeg', Medi('PHOTO'))))
        >>> print(m.ged())
        0 @M1@ OBJE
        1 FILE photo.jpg
        2 FORM image/jpeg
        3 MEDI PHOTO
        <BLANKLINE>

        This example shows a successful run of the Medi structure using
        the enumeration value 'AUDIO'.
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import Medi
        >>> m = Medi('AUDIO')
        >>> print(m.ged(2))
        2 MEDI AUDIO
        <BLANKLINE>

        This example shows the code that is generated to produce the same result as above.
        >>> print(m.code())
        <BLANKLINE>
        Medi('AUDIO')

    Examples:
        These are the steps to build the examples in the specification.
        First we will import the classes and then create a source cross reference `S1`.
        The void cross reference identifier comes from the Void class.
        >>> from genedata.build import Genealogy
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import Dscr, Page, Sour 
        >>> from genedata.structure import Void
        >>> g = Genealogy('example')
        >>> sour_xref = g.source_xref('S1')

        These are the steps to build the first example:
        >>> m = Sour(sour_xref, Page('Film: 1234567, Frame: 344, Line: 28'))
        >>> print(m.ged(2))
        2 SOUR @S1@
        3 PAGE Film: 1234567, Frame: 344, Line: 28
        <BLANKLINE>

        These are the steps to build the second example:
        >>> m = Dscr('Tall enough his head touched the ceiling', Sour(Void.SOUR, Page('His grand-daughter Lydia told me this in 1980')))
        >>> print(m.ged(1))
        1 DSCR Tall enough his head touched the ceiling
        2 SOUR @VOID@
        3 PAGE His grand-daughter Lydia told me this in 1980

        individual cross reference identifier `I2` for the fifth example:
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import Asso, Date, Givn, Marr, Name, Phrase, Role, Type
        >>> from genedata.build import Genealogy
        >>> g = Genealogy('example')
        >>> indi = g.individual_xref('I2')
        
        These are the steps for the first example.
        >>> m = Date('24 JUN 1852', Phrase('During the feast of St John'))
        >>> print(m.ged(2))
        2 DATE 24 JUN 1852
        3 PHRASE During the feast of St John
        <BLANKLINE>

        These are the steps for the second example.
        >>> m = Date('30 JAN 1649', Phrase('30th of January, 1648/9'))
        >>> print(m.ged(2))
        2 DATE 30 JAN 1649
        3 PHRASE 30th of January, 1648/9
        <BLANKLINE>

        These are the steps for the third example.
        >>> m = Date('BET 1648 AND 1649', Phrase('1648/9'))
        >>> print(m.ged(2))
        2 DATE BET 1648 AND 1649
        3 PHRASE 1648/9
        <BLANKLINE>

        These are the steps for the fourth example.
        >>> m = Date('BET 1 JAN 1867 AND 31 MAR 1867', Phrase('Q1 1867'))
        >>> print(m.ged(2))
        2 DATE BET 1 JAN 1867 AND 31 MAR 1867
        3 PHRASE Q1 1867
        <BLANKLINE>

        These are the steps for the fifth example.
        >>> m = Marr('', Asso(indi, Role('OTHER', Phrase('Maid of Honor'))))
        >>> print(m.ged(1))
        1 MARR
        2 ASSO @I2@

    GEDCOM Specification:
    > Individual
    > See `INDIVIDUAL_RECORD`.
    > The individual record is a compilation of facts or hypothesized facts about an
    > individual. These facts may come from multiple sources. Source citations and
    > notes allow documentation of the source where each of the facts were
    > discovered.
    > 
    > A single individual may have facts distributed across multiple individual
    > records, connected by `ALIA` (alias, in the computing sense not the pseudonym
    > sense) pointers. See `ALIA` for more details.
    > 
    > Individual records are linked to Family records by use of bi-directional
    > pointers. Details about those links are stored as substructures of the pointers
    > in the individual record.
    > 
    > Other associations or relationships are represented by the `ASSO` (association)
    > tag. The person's relation or associate is the person being pointed to. The
    > association or relationship is stated by the value on the subordinate `ROLE`
    > line. `ASSO` should not be used for relationships that can be expressed using
    > `FAMS` or `FAMC` instead.
    > 
    > <div class="example">
    > 
    > The following example refers to 2 individuals, `@I1@` and `@I2@`, where `@I2@`
    > is a godparent of `@I1@`:
    > 
    > ```gedcom
    > 0 @I1@ INDI
    > 1 ASSO @I2@
    > 2 ROLE GODP
    > ```
    > 
    > </div>
    > 
    > Events stored as facts within an `INDI` record may also have `FAMC` or `ASSO`
    > tags to indicate families and individuals that participated in those events.
    > For example, a `FAMC` pointer subordinate to an adoption event indicates a
    > relationship to family by adoption; biological parents can be shown by a `FAMC`
    > pointer subordinate to the birth event; the eulogist at a funeral can be shown
    > by an `ASSO` pointer subordinate to the burial event; and so on. A subordinate
    > `FAMC` pointer is allowed to refer to a family where the individual does not
    > appear as a child.

    Example:
        Here is the way to construct the ged lines in the example from the specification.
        First create the two individual cross reference identifiers.  Then let a
        RecordIndi class format them into the desired ged lines.
        >>> from genedata.build import Genealogy
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import Asso, RecordIndi, Role
        >>> g = Genealogy('example')
        >>> indi_i1_xref = g.individual_xref('I1')
        >>> indi_i2_xref = g.individual_xref('I2')
        >>> m = RecordIndi(indi_i1_xref, Asso(indi_i2_xref, Role('GODP')))
        >>> print(m.ged())
        0 @I1@ INDI
        1 ASSO @I2@
        2 ROLE GODP

    Examples:
        This example shows a successful run of the Resn structure using
        the enumeration value 'CONFIDENTIAL'.
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import Resn
        >>> m = Resn('CONFIDENTIAL')
        >>> print(m.ged(1))
        1 RESN CONFIDENTIAL

        This example shows the code that is generated to produce the same result as above.
        >>> print(m.code())
        <BLANKLINE>
        Resn('CONFIDENTIAL')
        
        More than one enumeration value may be entered for this particular
        enumeration set by separating the values with a comma.  For example,
        >>> n = Resn('CONFIDENTIAL, LOCKED')
        >>> print(n.ged(1))
        1 RESN CONFIDENTIAL, LOCKED
        <BLANKLINE>

    Examples:
        The first example of the specification could be coded by first creating
        the cross reference identifiers for the individual `I1` and the source `S1`.  
        This would be done as follows:
        >>> from genedata.build import Genealogy
        >>> g = Genealogy('example')
        >>> indi = g.individual_xref('I1')
        >>> sour = g.source_xref('S1')

        With these cross reference identifiers we can create the ged lines:
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import RecordIndi, IndiName, Sour, SourEven, Role
        >>> m = RecordIndi(indi, IndiName('Mary //', Sour(sour, SourEven('BIRT', Role('MOTH')))))
        >>> print(m.ged(1))
        0 @I1@ INDI
        1 NAME Mary //
        2 SOUR @S1@
        3 EVEN BIRT
        4 ROLE MOTH
        <BLANKLINE>

        The second example from the specification would be created as follows.
        There are two individuals in this example, `I2` and `I3`.  First
        create cross reference identifiers for them.
        >>> indi2 = g.individual_xref('I2')
        >>> indi3 = g.individual_xref('I3')
        With those cross reference identifiers we can complete the ged lines
        after importing the additional classes.
        >>> from genedata.class7 import Asso, Bapm, Phrase
        Now create the lines:
        >>> m = RecordIndi(
        ...     [
        ...         Asso(indi3, Role('FRIEND', Phrase('best friend'))),

    > A citation indicating that the pointed-to source record supports the claims
    > made in the superstructure. Substructures provide additional information about
    > how that source applies to the subject of the citation's superstructure:
    > 
    > - `PAGE`: where in the source the relevant material can be found.
    > - `DATA`: the relevant data from the source.
    > - `EVEN`: what event the relevant material was recording.
    > - `QUAY`: an estimation of the reliability of the source in regard to these
    >   claims.
    > - `MULTIMEDIA_LINK`: digital copies of the cited part of the source
    > 
    > It is recommended that every `SOURCE_CITATION` point to a `SOURCE_RECORD`.
    > However, a `voidPtr` can be used with the citation text in a `PAGE`
    > substructure. The `PAGE` is defined to express a "specific location within the
    > information referenced;" with a `voidPtr` there is no information referenced,
    > so the `PAGE` may describe the entire source.
    > 
    > A `SOURCE_CITATION` can contain a `NOTE_STRUCTURE`, which in turn can contain a
    > `SOURCE_CITATION`, allowing potentially unbounded nesting of structures.
    > Because each dataset is finite, this nesting is also guaranteed to be finite.

    > collaboration by distinguishing between a structure being edited and a new
    > structure being created. If an application allows structures to be edited in a
    > way that completely changes their meaning (e.g., changing all the contents of
    > an `INDI` record to have it describe a completely different person) then any
    > `UID`s should also be changed.

class Www(BaseStructure):

    This class was generated by `Construct.generate_class` in the prep module
    using GEDCOM yaml specification files.  Links were added to the specification 
    and tables constructed from the yaml files to aid the user of these classes.  
    DO NOT CHANGE THIS CLASS MANUALLY.  

    
    GEDCOM Specification:
    > Web address
    > A URL or other locator for a World Wide Web page of the subject of the
    > superstructure, as defined by any relevant standard such as 
    > [whatwg/url](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/), 
    > [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), 
    > [RFC 3987](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987), and so forth.
    > 
    > Like other substructures, the `WWW` structure provides details about the
    > subject of its superstructure. For example, a `MARR`.`WWW` is a world wide web
    > page of the marriage event, not the personal website of the couple or an entry
    > in an online database serving as a source documenting the marriage. However,
    > the meaning of `WWW` was only implicit when it was introduced in version 5.5.1
    > and many files were created that use `WWW` to store a more tangentially-related
    > web address, so applications are recommended to interpret the `WWW` structure's
    > meaning cautiously.
    > 
    > If an invalid or no longer existing web address is present upon import, it
    > should be preserved as-is on export.
    > 

    Examples:
        The following example would send a logging message warning
        that the site "abc" cannot be reached.
        >>> from genedata.util import Input
        >>> from genedata.classes7 import Www
        >>> response = Www(Input.www('abc'))
        >>> print(response.ged(1))
        1 WWW abc
        <BLANKLINE>
        
        If one doesn't want the check, one can just enter the url.
        According to the specification the url should be retained even
        it is not available.
        >>> m = Www('abc')
        >>> print(m.ged(1))
        1 WWW abc
        <BLANKLINE>
